# Personal Website

This site is my personal website that includes an about me section, recent projects, and contact links to other socials. The site is hosted on Netlify at https://chrismollica.netlify.app/. 

### Project Details
I wanted to create a simple page that had a brief summary about me as well as highlight some of my projects and skills. The sections are simple and responsive by using flexbox and grid layouts. The point of the site is not to be very fancy but provide a quick introduction into myself as well as links to other socials and projects. 

Before the About section, I included a 100vh intro section to set the theme for the page and to make use of some CSS skills such as animations and absolute positioning. My original design was a darker theme with contrasting bright colors and arrows but I didn't think it had any personality. I wanted the page to have a more relaxed, nature feel which is why I opted for the tan/natural color scheme. It's also why I decided to put a tree with a swing set and falling leaves. I'm no art student but I wanted the tree to look more like a coloring book and not look super detail realistic.

### Improvements
In the future when I get time I plan to update the page in a couple ways.

-Make the email more of a form so when you click it you can send me an email right there.

-Make the page more mobile responsive. You can side scroll and zoom out the page on mobile which makes it not look good. Also, when flipping my phone sideways two of the absolute positioned bars I added for asthetic get out of position. Right now the page set up to be viewed more on a desktop.
